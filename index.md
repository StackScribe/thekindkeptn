# The Kind Keptn

The kind keptn is designed as an easy way to evaluate [keptn](https://keptn.sh). The kind keptn is a disposable, fully functional kubernetes cluster, powered by k3d and all wrapped inside a single docker command.

The kind keptn is **not** designed for production or long term use. It is **not** designed to replace a [proper keptn installation](https://keptn.sh/docs/quickstart)

## Components

See [the components of kind keptn page](components.md) for what lives inside the kind keptn.
